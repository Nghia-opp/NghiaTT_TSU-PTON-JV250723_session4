    <p><b>A website</b> (also written as a <b>web site</b>) is one or more <span>web pages</span> 
        and related content that is identified by a common <span>domain name</span> 
        and published on at least one <span>web server</span>. Websites are typically 
        dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, 
        commerce, entertainment, or <span>social media</span>. <span>Hyperlinking</span> between web 
        pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a 
        <span>home page</span>. The <span>most-visited</span> sites are <span>Google</span>, <span>YouTube</span>, and <span>Facebook</span>.
    <p>All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the <span>World 
        Wide Web</span>. There are also private websites that can only be accessed 
        on a <span>private network</span>, such as a company's internal website for its 
        employees. <span>Users</span> can access websites on a range of devices, including 
        <span>desktops, laptops, tablets</span>, and <span>smartphones</span>. The app used on these 
        devices is called a <span>web browser</span>.
